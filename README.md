- âš¡ Fun fact: The Majority of Earthâ€™s Oxygen Is Produced by Oceans 
                Have you ever thought of where oxygen comes from? Most of us believe that we get oxygen from trees but you might not know that
                more than half of the earthâ€™s oxygen that we breathe comes from oceans.
                Various scientists estimate that 50%-80% of the earthâ€™s oxygen is produced by the oceans. The majority of this production is
                from plant-based marine organisms. Oceanic plankton, algae, seaweed,and some bacteria can photosynthesize & produce more than
                half of the worldâ€™s oxygen.
